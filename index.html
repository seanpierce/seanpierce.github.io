In the wake of the police murder of George Floyd and so many Black American people before him, I am writing to ask you to show your commitment to racial justice by opposing any increase in the Portland Police Bereau's budget. We urge Mayor Wheeler, and Wheeler's elected peers to whithdraw Wheeler's proposal to increase the Portland Police Bereau's budget, and instead re-allocate city resources form policing to social services wherever possible.%0D%0A%0D%0AThank you.">Open Mail</a>
