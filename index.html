            <h3>FULL STACK DEVELOPER, SOFTWARE ENGINEER</h3>
            <p class="justify">I'm an agile software engineer, programmer and full-stack developer with a focus on
              creative programming and efficient design. I strive to build software that is as structurally,
              semantically and aesthetically cohesive as it is intuitive for the user. I work collaboratively to
              isolate problems and implement simple and repeatable solutions.</p>
            <p class="justify blocker">As someone who takes responsibility for their own personal development, I’m
              continually re-evaluating and updating my skill sets as well as learning more about how I can better
              serve my community. Whether it be through volunteer work or personal projects, I'm constantly gaining new
              experiences that are directly applicable to my professional life. I'm an advocate for open-source
              technologies and a passionate solver of problems.</p>
