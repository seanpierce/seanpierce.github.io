              In my free time I am a <a href="http://seanpierce.us">music maker</a>. I appreciate many different styles, but I'm most fond of anything that works to blur genre lines. I've performed in many cities across North America and Europe. I enjoy visiting Mexico, drinking coffee, and sending videos of my cat to my wife.
